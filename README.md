# Quantum Machine Learning 

This repository introduces Quantum Machine Learning (QML), with a focus on solving regression problems using a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) with Qiskit.

Overview:
QNN for Regression: Learn how to integrate quantum circuits to model a regression task using parameterized quantum circuits.
Focus: We work with classical data and quantum processing (CQ) to illustrate the power of quantum circuits in machine learning.
Getting Started:
### Install dependencies:
pip install qiskit

Run the notebook for the QNN regression example.

Quantum Machine Learning Types:
This project focuses on CQ (Classical data, Quantum processing). Below is a visual explanation:
